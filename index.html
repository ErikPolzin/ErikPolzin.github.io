			If you're staring at this page, wondering what the heck you've just stumbled upon, you're not the only one.
			I don't know what this is, or what it will become. Most likely, it will end up becoming a digital equivalent
			of one of my many half-finished diaries that lie scattered around my room, forgotten. But, on the off chance
			that someone may find these pages, and in them find some joy or wisdom, I glady put these at your disposal.

			As you see this site now, it is probably still under development - there is always something to improve on web pages!
			But feel free to look around and see what you can see. You'll find an eclectic mix of my eclectic hobbies, from photography to programming.
			Some of it you may like, while some may not be to your taste. In both cases, feel free to send me and email
			to tell me what you think, or post something in the comments section. I'd love to hear from you.

			But popularity and social following is not the reason I manage this site. There are, quite literally,
			thousands of (admittedly better) ways I could try and do this. But that would be too easy. I'm serious.
			These days, everything is easy if it's online.
			Call me a hipster, but this is my reaction to an internet where anyone can post
			photos on Instagram, blog on Medium and chuck code on Github in seconds - creating it all (sort of) from scratch.
			But, even worse than an accessible internet, some people never start creating at all. After all,
			why write when you have access to a billion articles on the same type of Purple-winged ground-dove (or whatever it is that floats your boat).
			Why photograph when Google Images already has thousands of stock photos?
			Why write new code when there is already a library for it, and the solution to your problem is already on StackOverflow?
