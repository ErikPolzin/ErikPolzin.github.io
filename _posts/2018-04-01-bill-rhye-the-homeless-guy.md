Hoopvol Street was anything but hopeful, and everyone who lived there knew it. The smell of depression was practically tangible. It wafted out of the darkest corners and the dodgiest crannies that the seedy street had to offer. Beady, red-rimmed eyes would stare at you malevolently from the shadows, were you brave enough to walk its length. If this were the case, it was never long before you felt a knife pressed to your gut and a smoky voice whispering:
“Not from here, are we?”
Yet, amidst all this, there was old Bill Rhye. The ancient, homeless man was always to be found in his old camper-chair in the afternoon, perched precariously at the edge of the curb. Mr Rhye always wore an old tweed suit from another century, that had never been washed in its lifetime. He would slowly dip his hat to any passers-by, smile a warm, gap-toothed grin and then release a puff of smoke from his pipe.

I used to watch the man from my cubicle at IniTech. The reminder of his presence was sometimes all that kept me sane in the corporate world. Even though I had never spoken to him, the sight of his humble, watery smile was enough to give a new purpose to my day. Bill was like a reassuring friend.

Every morning, at nine o’clock, the old man would peer at his watch to convince himself that it was, in fact, nine o’clock. Satisfied, he would then grab an old tin of shoe polish and bend down to shine his shoes, whistling a lilting tune.
“A shoe-shined should never have dull shoes,” he would pronounce sagely, to no-one in particular. With the help of a walking stick, he would hoist himself to his feet with trembling arms. Every morning Bill Rhye would shuffle out to Main Street, where city life suddenly hit you like a freight train. Buses and cyclists flashed past with streaks of color, ahead of a wave of men and women in suits, talking to their cellphones in corporate jargon, oblivious to the world and shoving past and over and through anything in their way.
“Shoe shine! Get your shoes shined here. Cheap, cheap!” Bill inquired.
The crowd moved by, barely noticing the old man who clutched his handkerchief and hat in both hands, smiling as if he knew a secret no-one else did.

My new office was far above Hoopvol Street. From here I couldn’t even make out the figure of Mr Rhye, selling his services on Main Street. My new life as the owner of IniTech was busy, bland and banal. But I have made a resolution. I scribbled the necessary digits on the cheque.

Today, Bill Rhye trudged back into Hoopvol Street. It was evening, and his legs were aching after a day of standing and scrubbing. He coughed heavily into the crook of his arm. He’d been having health problems recently. After collapsing into his chair, he looked around furtively, before hauling out a battered old box from his bag. On the ground, he set up the chess board. He casually made White’s first move. As he had no-one to play against, he was about to humour the black side and make its first move, when a figure clad in black appeared in front of him.
“Do you want to play a game?” it asked.
Bill was but soon regained himself. He grinned and nodded enthusiastically, motioning for the figure to sit. Black made its first move.

I am in the lift, going down. I hear awful muzak playing from the tinny speakers. The cheque is in my hand. It’s an awfully long way down from my office, I think.

The game is not going well. If Bill is honest with himself, he has never been a very good chess player. Black doesn’t have many pieces yet, but Bill recognises that he has been out-skilled and outmanoeuvred.

Soon I will have arrived at IniTech’s exit; the entrance to Hoopvol Street. I will look across the road and see old Bill in his chair, playing chess. I will even face the dangers of Hoopvol’s infamous tenants as I walk across to him.

Eventually, Bill Rye will realise that he only has one piece left. His king.
It will be too late by then to resign and end it himself, so the old man will hang on grimly to the bitter end. The realisation will dawn on his lined, wrinkled face, as Black knocks his last figure to the ground. Bill will feel one last tug at his heat, then a sharp pain, and then... nothing.
Death will stand up grimly and make his way away from Hoopvol Street.

And, finally, I will arrive at the camper chair. I will say: “Hello, Bill, you don’t know me, but I have a gift for you.” I will hold up the cheque, and only then have noticed that the thin old man is staring at me with the glazed eyes of Death.

I will have looked around in horror and bewilderment, and catch a glimpse of a dark figure disappearing around the corner.
