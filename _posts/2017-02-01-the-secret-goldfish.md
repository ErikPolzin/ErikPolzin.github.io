I sit alone. Usually.  
I was sitting in my favourite spot, at my favourite time. It was morning, still dark, in fact. I had grabbed the earliest edition of the newspaper that I could find, and sat, legs crossed and newspaper propped open, on my bench. The sunlight was crawling down the rooftops, and a light breeze rustled the leaves in the streets.  
The streets are empty. Usually.

But today I heard the sound of a man shuffling in my direction from behind me. I resisted the urge to look up, but he slumped down on the bench next to me. I shot him a sideways glance.  
Greasy, greying hair; his face seemed droopy, like the sad cigarette hanging out of one corner of his mouth. Old, outdated tweed suit, ragged at the edges.  
He held a big, clear fish-bowl clutched under his arm, empty apart from some water sloshing around at the bottom.  

'Hehehee, I see yer've met the Prince,' he wheezed, seeing me staring.  
'The… prince?' I tried, tentatively.  
'Yeh,' he said. 'Cute, innit he.' He looked down at his fish tank fondly, giving it a little nudge.  
I nodded sagely.  
'Ye know, goldfish have 'strodinary memories. Never once forgotten a thing I told 'im, eh,  Aecheros?'  
He leant towards me suddenly, loamy blue eyes wide open. 'But don't you tell nobody. Prince Aecheros is a secret goldfish, 'e is; never shown 'im to a soul. 'Cause I bought him with my own pocket money. He's mine.'  
I looked at the tank sceptically, but failed to see the fish in question. 'Sure,' I said.  
'Good. Now, Aecheros' been around since I was eight. We had it good, back then, believe it or not,' he chuckled. 'Got my first portion of pocket-money then, and I went down to the pet store. Didn't have much, mind you, but Aecheros was on sale and I had walked over all the way from the other side of town, so I damn well was going to buy something. And a damn good choice 'e was too. Take a look at that face of his.' He pointed at the empty fish tank. 'You can tell he's cleverer than the others.'  
The strange man sighed. He seemed to forget where he was for a second, before returning with a snort.  
'But, now, where was I… Did I get to the part with Lloyds?'  
'Lloyds of Lon-', I interjected, confused.  
'Yes, the very same!' the old man crowed. 'A very good enterprise, very respectable. They were the insurance brokers at the time, the syndicate. We got a nice fancy letter in the mail the one day, 'bout a year before I met the Prince, asking us very politely if we wouldn't please consider joining 'the market leaders' with their 100% liability offer.  
Then a nice young man with a suit and a very big smile came over with a pen and lots of papers. He sat down with mum for the afternoon.
Me, I was playing with my trains 'round the corner. I was a-half listening; mister Big Smile used big words like 'investment and 'liability', but when I got bored of that I just went back to playing trains.  
Mum signed the papers.'  
The man stopped talking for a moment. I fiddled with the lapel of my pin-striped suit, nervously.  
'Well, so, a year later, I was a-coming home from the pet store with Prince Aecheros under my arm. Mr Big Smile was standing in front 'o the house, but he wasn't smiling no more. Mum was crying. She said that Lloyds was having a tough time, they needed to…'
'Recruit to reconstitute,' I said. He nodded.  
'Yeh. Didn't have the house any more. Still had the Prince. Still have 'im.'  
He patted the empty fish tank.  

He lapsed into an awkward silence while I stared at the crumpled remains of my newspaper.  
'Anyway, gotta go,' he said, eventually. 'Things to do. Places to be.'  
He took a puff of his cigarette, tossed it away and got up slowly, painfully, hobbling away.  
The sun had reached the golden lettering of the Lloyds Building, sparkling so brightly that I had to squint as I got up and walked towards it, slid my ID card into the scanner and sat down at my desk.
