You’re sitting on your couch in your living room. It’s early in the morning, and you’re busy drinking a cup of coffee. You hear a scratching at the door, and open it cautiously, only to find a strange-looking extraterrestrial lifeform waiting to be let in.

It makes a strange noise that you don’t understand, but you whiz out your phone and type it into Google Translate. The alien is asking “Who are you?”.  
You say: “I’m Erik”.2  
“What’s Erik?” puzzles the extraterrestrial lifeform.  
“Well, I’m Erik.”  
“So, what you’re really saying is that you are you.”  
You think for a moment. “I suppose that’s one way of seeing it, yes.”  
At this point, your best friend, Erik, comes walzing past, whistling a catchy tune.  
“Oh, hey Erik,” Erik says. “Who’s your friend?”  
“Oh, this is Bob. I think he’s an extraterrestrial lifeform.”  
“Hi there, Bob,” says Erik.  
“Hello,” says Bob. “So you’re an Erik too?”  
“I’m not just any Erik,” Erik retorts, mildly offended. “I’m the Erik. I’m me.”  
“But here’s the thing...” begins the alien, “If you’re Erik and Erik is Erik then Erik is you.”  
Erik points at you, chuckling. “You mean I must be him because we have the same name?”  
“What is a name?” asks Bob.  
(At this point a long and somewhat frustrating argument takes place, mostly due to some cultural malapropisms, but let’s stay on topic and skip this part.)  
“But I’m much more than just my name,” you are busy saying. “This Erik is very different to that Erik because... well, that Erik is shorter than me, for one. He has blonde hair, and -”  
“So if I were to do this...” the alien interjects, metamorphosing into a body exactly like  yours, “Then I would be you?”  
“Of course not!” says other Erik. “Erik has had different experiences than you have, and has different memories than you do-”  
“Now hang on a minute!” yells Sally, Erik’s twin sister, who is just returning from a session of extreme sports. “We’ve lived together for ages; I remember everything that you do. And I am certainly not you!”  
“Well then what else is there?” you gasp in exasperation. “If I were to look like Sally, and think like Sally, and talk like Sally then why would I still be me and not Sally?”  
“The way I see it,” concludes the alien, “Is that you are Sally, and Sally is me and I am you.”  
You take a moment to digest this hypothesis, but it makes you nauseous so all you manage is a faint nod. “Well now, I better get going. Good day to you,” the Extraterrestrial remarks. It lollops along, and soon your friends, too, disperse, leaving you to contemplate in dazed silence.  

These sorts of stories often pop into my head when I think about self identity. And usually they come along with some hefty existential questions, like: Am I different to other people? Would I still be me if I had a different body, another mind? What if I had grown up as a ‘different’ person next door to where I am now? Many people, instinctively, answer ‘yes’ to these questions, simply because they cannot imagine being anyone other than themselves. Were your consciousness suddenly to be transplanted into someone else’s head, with their body and memories becoming yours, even then there must be some part of me that is present in them.
But this is wistful thinking. We like to believe that there is some part of us, some element of our soul that is unique to us – something that sets us apart from others, something that would stay with us no matter who we end up being in life, no matter where we are and what happens to us. We call this part us our ‘self identity’.  
I have given this concept of self identity a good deal of thought, and come to the conclusion that there is no self identity, or at least no identity specific to each person. Why I have reached this bizarre conclusion, and how I reached it, will hopefully become apparent in this essay.

A few weeks ago, I was sitting at my laptop, programming what is called a Neural Net – the construct that enables computers to learn like humans. It does this by using a structure similar to the brain, with each neuron connected to each neuron in the next row by their weight and bias3. The analogy is not perfect, but it struck me how accurately this process describes how people work4 – outside stimuli, like our nature (here the bias) and nurture (the weight), determine what is processed in our minds, and generate our thoughts, and lead to the actions that make us seem to be us, and lead us to think that we are therefore somehow unique. But neither nature, nor nurture, make us unique. Think of it like this:  
We can agree that nature and nurture – like our DNA and the neighbourhood we grew up in – can can be more or less similar to those of another person. But our personal identity, like our ID number, cannot be measured to have any similarity to those of other people. The one cannot correlate to the other.  
If this seems like a loophole to you, imagine it as if you were playing a game with me. I cannot claim that I am winning the game if I also maintain that the game has no winners. The parameters I used to determine that I was ‘winning’ must be inconsequential to the outcome of the game, just as nature and nurture must have inconsequential effects on our unique identity.

Perhaps, I ask myself, self identity is not something that is developed through my nature and nurture, and rather something we are all born with. This seems to make a lot of sense, and explains why people seem to have a special character about them, influencing their thoughts and actions.  
But people change. Like the Ship of Theseus, at some point in our lives, the way we look, act and feel will all be different to those of our younger selves. The person we were in high-school might even have more similarities to, say, his teacher at the time, than to himself when he is that teacher’s age - even if they have different hypothetical identities. But what is the point of having this identity if it cannot differentiate you from other people?

These thoughts and experiences, among others, have made me question whether or not there is such a thing as a personal identity at all.
Instead of claiming to have one’s own identity, like our gut and ego tell us to, we should rather see ourselves as an empty container that has been filled with experiences and attributes that make us what we are. At the end of the day, there is nothing that differentiates one person from another, other than their personal attributes and experiences, so therefore we must be the collection of these, nature and nurture combined.  
This is far from being a cold, scientific analysis of one’s identity; in fact, there is a certain comfort in being able to answer the question “Who are you?” with: “I am you.”
